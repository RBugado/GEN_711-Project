# GEN_711-Project

My project will be assembling the genome of an unknown fish from the Oyster River in order to identify its origin, what species it is, and if it is a hybrid.

## Background

This data originated from me. An unknown fish was caught in the Oyster River by New Hampshire Fish and Game, and I used Oxford Nanopore Technologies GridION to sequence its genome. My goal was to determine the species of the unknown fish, as well as if it is a hybrid. This is important because fish hybridization can make habitat management difficult, as it's hard to estimate the numbers and range of a particular species.
